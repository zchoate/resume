- **Customer Identity Platform (CIAM) Design and Delivery:**
   - Assumed full technical ownership of a CIAM initiative originally scoped as an advisory engagement with an external vendor; identified architectural concerns with the proposed Azure AD B2C approach and led a technology pivot to Keycloak to better meet long-term business requirements.
   - Architected and delivered the resulting CIAM platform built on Keycloak, hosted on Azure App Service with Azure Front Door for global ingress, WAF, and TLS termination — deployed end-to-end via Terraform.
   - Built a management abstraction layer in Go to expose a controlled API surface over Keycloak administration operations, reducing operational exposure and enabling self-service workflows.
   - Developed a custom Keycloak theme using Keycloakify and React, providing a branded and accessible authentication experience aligned with product UX standards.
   - Extended Keycloak with custom Java extensions to support business-specific authentication flows and identity brokering requirements.
- **Stakeholder Engagement and Project Ownership:**
   - Gathered and translated requirements from business and product stakeholders into a phased technical delivery plan.
   - Owned project communications across the full lifecycle — from discovery through go-live — maintaining alignment between technical execution and business expectations.
   - Retained ownership of production support post-launch, establishing a feedback loop with stakeholders to drive iterative improvement.
- **Continued Strategic and Advisory Responsibilities:**
   - Continued to apply cloud architecture expertise in an advisory capacity, informing standards and contributing to broader organizational cloud strategy.
