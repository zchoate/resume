  label: Cloud Architect | Industrial & Manufacturing
  summary: >
    Cloud architect working with manufacturing and industrial companies to modernize infrastructure
    and help developer teams get things done. Most of this work is about reshaping how traditional
    IT operates to actually support software development — putting governance, cloud standards, and
    IIoT foundations in place at organizations where those things are often built from scratch.

work:
  - name: IDEX Corporation
    position: Cloud Architect
    startDate: "2025-01-01"
    highlights:
      - "Technical lead for the Customer Identity Platform, a production CIAM system serving external customers across IDEX's global eCommerce storefronts. Own the architecture, delivery, production support, and business stakeholder relationships; an MSP handles infrastructure monitoring under my direction."
      - "Took over a CIAM initiative originally scoped as a vendor advisory engagement. Identified fundamental architectural problems with the proposed Azure AD B2C approach and made the case to pivot to Keycloak, which better fit the long-term business needs."
      - "Designed and delivered the Keycloak-based CIAM platform on Azure App Service, with Azure Front Door handling global ingress, WAF, and TLS termination, deployed entirely via Terraform."
      - "Built a Go service wrapping Keycloak's admin API to limit which operations are exposed, making it safe for teams to manage their own identity configuration without direct Keycloak access."
      - "Built a custom Keycloak login theme with Keycloakify and React to match IDEX's product UX standards."
      - "Wrote custom Java extensions for Keycloak to handle non-standard authentication flows and identity brokering."
      - "Worked directly with business and product stakeholders to define requirements and build a delivery plan. Ran project communications from kickoff through go-live."
      - "Kept ownership of production support after launch, staying in regular contact with stakeholders to prioritize ongoing improvements."
      - "Continue to advise on cloud architecture decisions and set standards outside of the CIAM platform, contributing to IDEX's broader cloud direction."
      - "Serve as the go-to for developer teams navigating cloud infrastructure at a company that hasn't traditionally prioritized software development, working through deployment patterns, scaling needs, and application hosting as IDEX grows its software product portfolio."

      - "Set cloud adoption standards and best practices, working with business unit stakeholders to make sure they fit how IDEX actually operates."
      - "Primary resource for cloud-native questions across Azure, Kubernetes, and infrastructure as code for internal teams."
      - "Worked with development groups to improve their DevOps practices and cloud setup, with a focus on faster, more reliable deployments."
      - "Found recurring patterns across business unit solutions and pushed for shared approaches to cut duplicated effort and lower costs."
      - "Built a proof-of-concept IoT data acquisition system with remote connectivity to low-power devices running on cellular connections."
      - "Delivered reusable IaC modules for several standard patterns: multi-region hub-and-spoke networking, Kubernetes cluster bootstrapping, Azure self-hosted integration runtime with domain join and unattended provisioning in Data Factory, and a subscription vending machine with security guardrails."
      - "Set up and structured a GitHub Enterprise organization to support collaboration across IDEX's decentralized business units."
